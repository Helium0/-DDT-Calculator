Worked with Excel file and aplication. I wanted to try and learn DDT software testing methodology.
I have to say it was fun :)

Logic to attach excel cells is simple and understandable. I took some random calculator and placed few tests for a little challenge.
You can copy my code and try to add few more tests.


First time I have challenged meta-select tag here as I have never worked with application written in Angular before.
